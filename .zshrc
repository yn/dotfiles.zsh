#Ideally, we could run compinit just once, in a way that captures its changes to the environment
#Running compinit from this file after loading the compinit plugin doesn't work - get lots of zcompdump errors
#Not running compinit from this file at all means 'zplg cdreplay' doesn't work
#However, running it before the plugin means that we don't capture the function declarations in the compinit plugin report
